Lobcder configuration files

All configuration file should be located at ~/.lobcder/
In there we have 3 types of files.
The ~/.lobcder-test/lobcder.prop that sets the values:  
lobcder.storage.prefix=LOBCDER-REPLICA-v1.1 which is the name of the folder which 
lobcder will create on the storage sites and use for storing the physical data.
So if for example we use as a storage site the endpoint sftp://host/path the file 
with the logical name file1 will be loacted at
sftp://host/path/LOBCDER-REPLICA-v1.1/file1

lobcder.storage.site.prop.files=/home/user/.lobcder/storage1.prop,/home/user/.lobcder/storage2.prop,/home/user/.lobcder/storage3.prop
This is the name that specifies the location of storage sites description that lobcder can use.
They must be comma separated absolute paths 

The ~/.lobcder/datanucleus.properties that configures datanucleus 
(see http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/guides/jdo/tutorial.html)
The most important values for this file are: 
datanucleus.ConnectionDriverName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lobcderFSTest
datanucleus.ConnectionUserName=lobcder
datanucleus.ConnectionPassword=password

The  ~/.lobcder/storageX.prop which has the following form 
vph.users=uname1,uname2,uname2,unameN #The name of vph users that have the right to use this storage site 
storage.site.username=user #The username for the credentials for this storage site 
storage.site.password=password #The password for the credentials for this storage site 
storage.site.grid.proxy=notyet #Not imlemented yet
storage.site.endpoint=sftp://host/ #The host endpoint. At the moment we accept these schemas: file://, swift://, sftp://
