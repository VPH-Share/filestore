As sent by Dmitry in a previous mail :
The service description.
1. Each file has "supervised" property. You can get the list of files (their metadata) by GET query /rest//Items?path=/path/to/parent/dir in JSON or XML format
path parameter shall point to parent directory. The result is the matadata for all files which are located under this parent dir or any subdirectory located in this dir.

2. To set "supervised" property for all files located under a specified directory a client shall send PUT query with URL /rest//Items/TRUE?path=/path/to/parent/dir

3. To reset "supervised" property for all files located under a specified directory a client shall send PUT query with URL /rest//Items/FALSE?path=/path/to/parent/dir

4.To get a metadata in JSON or XML format for a file specified by its UID a client shall send GET query with URL  /rest/Item/{uid} where uid is file unique identifier

5. To set "supervised" flag for a specific file  a client shall send PUT query with URL  /rest/Item/{uid}/supervised/{flag} where uid is file unique identifier and flag is TRUE or FALSE

6. PUT /rest/Item/{uid}/checksum/{checksum} sets checksum (checksum is an integer)

7. PUT /{uid}/lastValidationDate/{lastValidationDate} sets lastValidationDate (lastValidationDate is a number of seconds from 0-date)

LastValidationDate is integer, not DateTime! Take it as a generic Integer property, however I assume it is number of milliseconds from 0-date.

The file properties can also be set/get using PROPFIND/PROPPATCH WebDAV command. They are located under "custom:" namespace  and have names:
dri-supervised
dri-checksum
dri-last-validation-date-ms
