This is are some basic instruction on how to configure and deploy LOBCDER 


1. How to create MySQL DB

Connect to the local database server as user root
You will be prompted for a password.

$mysql -h localhost  -u root -p
$mysql> create database mydb;

Now we create the user 'username' and give him full permissions on the new 
database

$mysql> grant CREATE,INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT on mydb.* to username@localhost identified by 'password';


2. LOBCDER configuration files

All configuration files should be located at ~/.lobcder/ or in some cases in 
~/.lobcder-test/ (this is defined in the code in nl.uva.cs.lobcder.util.Constants) 
In there we have 3 types of files: 
a) lobcder.prop 
b)~datanucleus.properties
c) STORAGE_SITE_FILE.prop

The lobcder.prop is the main configuration file. It defines the following values:
    a)lobcder.storage.prefix=LOBCDER-REPLICA-v1.1
    This is the name of the folder which LOBCDER will create on the storage site
    and use for storing the physical data.
    So if for example we use as a storage site with the endpoint 
    sftp://host/path any data stored by LOBCDER will be located in 
    sftp://host/path/LOBCDER-REPLICA-v1.1/

    b)lobcder.storage.site.prop.files=/home/user/.lobcder/storage1.prop,
    /home/user/.lobcder/storage2.prop,/home/user/.lobcder/storage3.prop
    This property specifies the location of storage sites property files.
    They must be comma separated absolute paths.

    c)datanucleus.properties 
    This file configures datanucleus 
    (see http://www.datanucleus.org/products/datanucleus/guides/jdo/tutorial.html)

    The most important values for this file are: 
    datanucleus.ConnectionDriverName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    datanucleus.ConnectionURL=jdbc:mysql://localhost/lobcderFSTest
    datanucleus.ConnectionUserName=lobcder
    datanucleus.ConnectionPassword=password

    d)storageX.prop
    This is a file describing the storage site LOBCDER may use. It has the 
    following form:
    vph.users=uname1,uname2,uname2,unameN   #The name of vph users that have the 
                                            right to use this storage site (may 
                                            be deprecated )
    storage.site.username=user              #The username for the credentials 
                                            for this storage site 
    storage.site.password=password          #The password for the credentials 
                                            for this storage site 
    storage.site.grid.proxy=notyet          #Not implemented yet
    storage.site.endpoint=sftp://host/      #The host endpoint. At the moment we 
                                            accept these schemas: file://, 
                                            swift://, sftp:// 

3. Deploy LOBCDER

3.1 Using NetBeans
    Build the project and run it (Right click on the project and select run ). 
    To specify an application server see 
    (http://wiki.netbeans.org/AddExternalTomcat) 
    
3.2 Using command line
    run: 
    $mvn install

    then deploy the war workspace/lobcder/target/lobcder-X-SNAPSHOT.war in 
    apache or glassfish
